Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**. Please review these guidelines before continuing.

## Etiquette

This project is open source, and as such, the maintainers give their free time to build and maintain the source code
held within. They make the code freely available in the hope that it will be of use to other developers. It would be
extremely unfair for them to suffer abuse or anger for their hard work.

Please be considerate towards maintainers when raising issues or presenting pull requests. Let's show the
world that developers are civilized and selfless people.

It's the duty of the maintainer to ensure that all submissions to the project are of sufficient
quality to benefit the project. Many developers have different skillsets, strengths, and weaknesses. Respect the maintainer's decision, and do not be upset or abusive if your submission is not used.

## Viability

When requesting or submitting new features, first consider whether it might be useful to others. Open
source projects are used by many developers, who may have entirely different needs to your own. Think about
whether or not your feature is likely to be used by other users of the project.

## Guidelines

* Please follow the [Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/basecodeoy/php-cs-fixer-config/blob/main/src/Presets/Standard.php).
* Ensure that the current tests pass, and if you've added something new, add the tests where relevant.
* Send a coherent commit history, making sure each commit in your pull request is meaningful.
* You may need to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.
* If you are changing or adding to the behaviour or public API, you may need to update the docs.
* Please remember that we follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Running Tests

First, install the dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash

Then run [Pest](https://pestphp.com/):

```bash

```

* The tests will be automatically run by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) against pull requests.
